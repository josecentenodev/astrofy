After immersing myself in years of chemical engineering studies, an unexpected spark ignited my true passion: programming mathematical equations and formulas. The idea of efficiently solving complex calculations fascinated me. I took a radical turn and applied for a switch to systems engineering. However, life had other plans, and I found myself at a crossroads, compelled to leave university.

My journey began as an IT consultant, where each piece of the puzzle was vital, ranging from code to the database, from users to developers. I found myself immersed in a perfect balance between development and client needs. In this environment, communication emerged as a powerful tool. The obligation to train and persuade went hand in hand with tasks like reports and maintenance.

Each day was a roller coaster of emotions, but as time progressed, a truth became evident: my place was in development. Driven by insatiable curiosity and a desire to learn, I absorbed knowledge self-taught, seizing the opportunity to work on a system of colossal scale.

Though work and knowledge flowed, it wasn't enough. My nights turned into study sessions at home, tackling courses, videos, and books. I coded tirelessly, keeping up with programming paradigm shifts and the constant evolution of software development.

After years of study and perseverance, my opportunity finally arrived: a position as a front-end developer on a large-scale project. In a compact and well-organized team, I delved into technologies like React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and explored the fascinating world of scrum. I discovered solid principles and software development concepts like SOLID.

This journey has been a kaleidoscope of challenges, learning, and self-discovery. From those early coding days to today, the passion for web development has taken me to places I never imagined. The road may be steep, but each challenge overcome has only strengthened my determination.

In every line of code, I've discovered not just a tool but a form of expression. Web development is not just a career; it's a journey of constant growth. Today, I am a developer, a storyteller through code, and my journey is far from over!
